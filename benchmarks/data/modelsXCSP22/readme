In this directory, you will find all model and data files for the main CSP/COP tracks of the 2022 XCSP3 Competition.
For some problems, a few minor differences may exist when generating XCSP3 files, compared to those used 
during the competition. This is because some instances were generated several months or years ago (e.g., in 2018),
while having some models still slightly evolving.
Anyway, if you want to make a comparison between a solver ond those run during the 2022 competition,
you have to directly work with the XCSP3 files of the 2022 competition.
